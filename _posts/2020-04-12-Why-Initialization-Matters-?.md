# Overview 

*Weight Initialization* is most underated concept in the deep learning terminology. I have seen many newbie deep learning practioners and even some experienced one ignoring this important concept.
Unlike some already available tutorials or blogs we will not talk about why you should not initialize your weights with all zeros or all ones rather we will make relation between the eigen vectors and proper weight initialization.
